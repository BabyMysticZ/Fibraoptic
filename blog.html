              <h3>How to testspeed?</h3>
              <p>
                We all usually know the connection speed that we have contracted
                with our operator, but it is also common that sometimes we have
                doubts as to whether we are getting all the speed that it
                should. This can be due to many causes, but the first check is
                always the same: make a measurement. It's pretty easy to do, but
                can get unnecessarily complicated if you don't know where to
                turn. For this reason, today we are going to tell you how to
                measure the speed of your Internet connection, both on your
                desktop or laptop computer and on your mobile device.

              <h3>In conclusion</h3>

              <p>
                Fiber optic internet speed is about twenty times faster than any
                cable internet connection, and eighty times faster than DSL.
                With prices ranging between two hundred and four hundred pesos
                per month, fiber optics is the perfect alternative for most
                Internet users. But finding fiber optic internet services can be
                difficult, because its coverage extends to a very small
                percentage of homes and almost all of them are based in large
                cities. In addition, the widespread race to spread the use of 5G
                technology has had an impact on the installation of fiber optic
                cable connections.
